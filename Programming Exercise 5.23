// CHAPTER 5: EXERCISE 5.23 (Financial application: compare loans with various interest rates)

// Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount and loan period in number of years 
// and displays the monthly and total payments for each interest rate starting from 5% to 8%,
// with an increment of 1/8.
