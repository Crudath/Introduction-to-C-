# Introduction-to-CPP

Programming Fundamentals I - Introduction to C++ by Dr. Liang - My Code for Quizzes, Projects, &amp; Exercises

PURPOSE:

The purpose of creating this repository is to record my progression throughout each chapter of the book.

GOALS:

To display improvement in coding throughout each chapter.

SECONDARY PURPOSE:

To help fellow new programmers, such as myself, review their own code when they hit a brickwall.
Beware that the monumental hell that is involved with learning a coding language seemingly gets worse before it gets better.
Do Not Quit. Perservere. Take breaks when necessary, and come back with a clearer (humbled) mindset.

Stay Frosty...
